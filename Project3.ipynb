    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is an important branch in physics that is used to describe physical behaviours at the smallest scales. The description of physical systems depends on solving the  Schrödinger equation since the solutions can be used to describe the behaviour of subatomic, atomic and molecular systems. However, it can be solved analytically for very few systems, requiring a sufficiently good numerical method when no analytical solution exists.  [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322593570_A_Matrix_Method_of_Solving_the_Schrodinger_Equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a numerical algorithm, the matrix method, was used to solve the Schrödinger equation where the boundary conditions are known. A basis set of functions were chosen which obey boundary conditions and linear combinations of them were found in order to approximate the wave function. The wave function was then substituted into the Schrödinger equation and pre-multiplied by each of the basis. By integrating, a series of linear equations was obtained that was written as a matrix equation. The matrix was then represented in terms of its eigenvalues (eigenenergies) and eigenvectors (corresponding multipliers of  basis).[[2]](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ExactSolutionForRectangularDoubleWellPotential/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the one-dimensional, time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved for two systems: the particle in a box, with and without a potential barrier. The particle in a box problem is a common application of a quantum mechanical model to a simplified system. It describes the horizontal translation motion of a particle confined in an infinitely deep well from which it cannot escape. Adding a potential barrier inside the infinite well allows us to study quantum tunneling; a phenomenon in which a particle penetrates a potential energy barrier with a height greater than the energy of the particle. The phenomenon is exciting because it violates the principles of classical mechanics by allowing particles can get through classically forbidden regions and is possible because in quantum mechanics, particles show wave properties. It is essential in modeling the Sun and other stars, and has a wide range of applications, such as transistors, integrated circuits and the scanning tunneling microscope.[[3]]()\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytical solution for both systems is known so they were compared to the numerical solutions, testing the suitability of the matrix method. For the infinite square well, the results match the analytical solutions well. However, when the barrier was added, the solutions were correct for a small range of the initial parameters."

Interact autogenerated a slider bound to each parameter, and then called each function with those arguments, allowing them to be manipulated interactively.

    "\n",
    "The graphs rightly show that in that the lowest possible energy of a particle is never zero even when the potential is zero within the well. This suggests the particle can never be at rest and will always have some kinetic energy, even at zero Kelvin. This obeys the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: if a particle's energy was zero, its position in time would be precisely known. The energies rightly increase logarithmically. However, the higher the energy the more inaccurate it is and always higher than the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few basis functions are needed to obtain accurate wavefunctions if the basis functions and exact solutions are very similar. At least 9 polynomial functions were needed, more than the cosine functions (5) to yield the correct wavefunctions. For both systems, an increase in basis improves the wavefunctions but worsens the energies.The inversion of wavefunctions may be due to a phase change rather than multiplication by a negative sign as it depends on N. The erroneous highest wave of the double well indicates that only one of the phases can be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms are not very fast and become slower with N. A large part of the time taken is in calculating the eigenvalues."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The infinite well is the simplest system and was evaluable. However, by adding a barrier, it was impossible to obtain any results unless the exact solutions were used as ansatz. If the basis chosen is suitable, for more accurate results simply use a greater number of basis. However, when tested on such a basic system as the simple double-well, a problem of inversion of the wavefunctions occurs. This should be fixed before applying the algorithm to any more complicated systems of which the solutions are not known. The algorithm also appears to be limited, as it cannot produce even an approximate solution for certain parameters, such for the double-well when Width$ \\geq $0.50 units. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the matrix method is successful in some respects and is a relatively simple and fast. Having bigger matrices and N or plotting more of the wavefunctions will likely slow it down considerably. The time taken for just producing the eigenvalues for the polynomials, more than doubled at one instance from 180 ± 22.1 ms to 522 ± 13.5 ms per loop when doubling N.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method could be useful when the exact solutions are not known, but the basis functions must be very good ansatz. It could also be easily adapted to work with complex basis by taking the complex conjugate of the first ($i^\\text{th}$) basis when creating the matrices. For a more quantitative analysis the basis can be normalised and a curve can be fitted to the energy values, so that both could be compared with the analytical solutions. "
